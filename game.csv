This does lead to balance that is clearly towards light ACs, no matter what I did I could never make a quad AC work as well as my simple super lightweight AC, specially since heavy weapons, such as the back cannon, have very heavy recoil that stops you on your tracks, and not moving 24/7 like it's fucking Doom Eternal is an objectively bad strategy. There's also a lot less parts than the previous installments, for example there's only around 6 heavy back weapons, 2 quad legs and 2 tank threads.

It was the first full post-war World War II decade that began the information age that we are still currently living in, marked by a greater emphasis on progressing social changes and the quality of human life once we maximized exploration and industry production in decades prior. The economic boom created by the impact of WWII ushered in an era of prosperity, and it seemed like the American dream had come true. Squeaky-clean, conservative values defined the idyllic society that the 1950s upheld: waspy nuclear families where dad wore a suit and tie to his 9 to 5, and mom stayed home all day making dad dinner and cleaning the house. At the same time, little Timmy played baseball with his friends, and little Susie played with her dolls. Not only was the American dream of the 1950s eerily pristine, but it was also boring. Even the leather-jacketed, rock-and-roll counterculture seems like a quaint facet of the decade, or maybe we have Fonzie to thank for making a mockery of it. To retain this halcyon society, the 1950s upheld a strong sense of conformity with zero leeway for any abstract thought or anything outside the very anglo-centric, heteronormative bubble encapsulating the decade.

Good, you\'re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection.

A pipe could burst, a meteor could smash into the room, an airlock could open sending anything and everything not anchored into space, or an enemy could crawl through a vent and start wrecking your dudes.

But once something unexpected happens and you need to get your drones out fast, you need to be able to know how to get every drone where you want it as fast as possible. Thankfully, there\'s some command shortcuts like ""exit"", which sends your buddies booking for the exit, and you can also macro sets of commands if you really want to optimize things.

Using the power of emulation, I got it completely playable on Dolphin, where she took the helm and played it the whole way through.

A lot of people see this as the quintessential Fire Emblem game, as well as the peak. It gets close, but I think the reason why people deem that is because of its heightened fantasy elements. Instead of having only Manaketes as supposed ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sub-humansï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which is a funny play on racism, the Manaketes were renamed to Dragon Laguz, because thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what they are, esseSaber Toothed Tigers, Lions, Crows, Hawks, White Herons, and of course, Dragons.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.
             

              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","[""It's a game.

Most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. This game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so that's neat. There are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so GH maniacs still have fun things to do I feel. Overall, it's more guitar hero.

Pit of Kid Icarus fame is back in a new game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system, by Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, and his development team at Project Sora.
             

              Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and action-packed blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on elegantly intuitive and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.
             

              Boasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.
             

              The hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.
             

              Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.
             

              Players can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.","[""another thing where if it got a remaster could be one of the very best. the controls hold it back at a fundamental level, and with the strives in accessibility in gaming made since its release im all but certain that would be alleviated in any kind of port. still an incredible game if you're Able to play it, but there shouldn't be a barrier like that in the first place"", ""In an unexpected sequel, Kid Icarus finds new light in an amazingly lighthearted world.

              The story takes place after the events of Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance. It features an older Sora as the main protagonist, who sets forth on a new adventure to search for seven guardians of light in an attempt to stop Xehanort from bringing about a second Keyblade War. Sora is joined by Donald Duck, Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Riku, Kairi, and others. Along the way, Sora travels to many worlds from Disney and Pixar intellectual properties, and cross paths with the real Organization XIII.
             

              Kingdom Hearts III features hack and slash combat reminiscent of Kingdom Hearts II, with elements from later handheld entries, allowing the player to control Sora in a party with Donald, Goofy, and up to two other Disney characters from the various worlds he visits. A major addition compared is the Formchange mechanic, which allows his currently equipped Keyblade to grant him special abilities and change shape. Sora can equip up to three Keyblades at a time, and cycle between them to use his abilities.

A. Salvatore. Brought to life visually through the trademark visceral style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, Reckoning brings a new level of intense action combat to the RPG genre.","[""As the first RPG that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. Funny enough, i've played more JRPGs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. Still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. Wish it performed better financially"", 'There are some movies and TV shows that I\'m convinced only really ""hit"" if you watch them at a certain age. It is my firm belief that if you haven\'t watched Star Trek, Mean Girls, or The Breakfast Club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things (at least, I did not)*. Similarly, I think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life.\n                     \n                     Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is one of those games. This game would have been really cool if I had played it when I was 10-12 (it was not out in the mid-00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my Mom\'s one-woman censorship board). It would probably be pretty cool if I was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. However, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring.\n                     \n                     First offender is the combat. The combat is in real time, and feels close to Dragon\'s Dogma or Scarlet Nexus, if you are familiar with those games. The combat in Amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. There is only one basic attack (no light/heavy attacks or parries), a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. The spells are kind of cool, but they,  can\'t really be chained into combos,. There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic ""tap X"" sequence is keenly felt. The swift, exciting, and somewhat open-ended combat of Devil May Cry has spoiled me, I suppose.\n                     \n                     It is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but I didn\'t find the ones that I unlocked useful. Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\n                     \n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\'s not great, but I\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\'t shoved in your face by ""cinematic"" cutscenes. The dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. I highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference; developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling.\n                     \n                     The ""open world"" is a series of poorly-disguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. The game feels less open than an N64 Zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. Thus, there\'s no real exploration in the game; not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. I found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. The semi-cartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. Every NPC has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting.  The loot system was not engaging or addicting; there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, I didn\'t really feel excited to upgrade my gear. I am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case Skyrim did all of these better than Amalur.\n                     \n                     Everything about this game just felt like busywork. I could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but Amalur just feels like Fantasy Game: The Game. Everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. I don\'t know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense I felt while playing it. It was the opposite of Skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. Amalur feels like playing a fantasy game (quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an MMO) and nothing about it grabbed me. In my earlier years I may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, I can\'t justify playing this game.', ""'na verga"", ""'tis a beauty of a game. I was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely grey/brown Skyrim. It's basically just Skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. It honestly felt kind of similar to the original God of War games in that way."", ""For a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition.

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games, the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\n                     \n                     The presentation is cute, the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see, but as far as gameplay goes, SSU doesn\'t do too much to add from the original ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which I definitely have qualms over.\n                     \n                     Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\'t that great in this either, but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel at the time, but felt like it could\'ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into, mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\'t) drowned my joy out.\n                     \n                     I don\'t have much to say about the rest, everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight. Meta Knightmare felt the most fun to play and control with the energy system being cool enough, but I don\'t care too much about the ""minigame"" direction chosen. I personally prefer a centralized thing, and each segment didn\'t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route, though.\n                     \n                     There is no bad Kirby game, and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough, but I have to give it my personal ""OK"" rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad. Other games have more to offer and feel better to play, and all the ""hip and cool"" concepts of this game are mostly at the end of one\'s playthrough to postpone playing it (if you\'re not playing Kirbies in order).

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.
             

              There are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).
             

              The single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.
             

              Toy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","['MAKE ANOTHER MARIO BASEBALL GAME', 'Its baseball but with all of the standard mario fun packed in.

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The ""Metal Gear Solid (MGS)"" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society.

Hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. Or sneak inside, I don\'t care. This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.\n                     \n                     Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die, you can approach it a completely different way.\n                     \n                     This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their anti-air radar, and their electrical power. Don\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\n                     \n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\'s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.\n                     \n                     I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; there\'s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu.\n                     \n                     These are small complaints, however, and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played. Since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, I heartily recommend buying it.\n                     \n                     One more thing: you can put your own music into the game to play through your Pokedex or on the helicopter.

Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure, to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp, such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.

Yeah, theres no crash, spyro, solid snake, or cloud, but they got a lot of other interesting games represented by both characters and stages, which is honestly really cool in the same way getting an unknown thing in smash is. You get to learn a lil bit more about sonys various IPs that you might not have otherwise known, I guess. Gameplaywise though this is definitely not smash brothers. You can only score points and defeat players by using super moves which makes most of the actual fighting kinda feel like irrelevant filler...? The game also lacks the special level of polish and attention to detail that nintendo puts in smash as well, which just makes the overall experience underwhelming.

The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a ""super hint"", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of ""Picarats"", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses.","['10/10 would cry again', 'Man what a great game, by far the best in the series (so far) the game was a joy to play, the story was great and even tho I was spoiled  out of context I knew there was a twist, but the game was great, the ending even made me cry which few games make me cry.

We all thought that it had promise and it sure was unfortunate that the GBA version never manifested.\n                     \n                     The second game (Risky\'s Revenge) was more like a tech demo than an actual game, but releasing it as DSiWare meant that it didn\'t need to really be more of that. In the end, it had a bit of overworld, two dungeons, and a weirdly boring shmup section before the final boss. (No joking; I played through this game twice, several years apart, and I literally dozed off during the mermaid shmup part both times.) Truly, this series just needed a chance to get a new, REAL, release that would let it stretch its psuedo-Metroidvania wings and be an amazing game!\n                     \n                     Well, we more-or-less got that with Pirate\'s Curse. While the Metroidvania aspects were still very simplistic - the world was broken up into several islands, most of which had extremely linear maps - the new pirate abilities were much more fun and easy to use than the old transformations, so it was still fun to backtrack through the islands to find hidden items. (The series is closer to a sidescrolling Zelda, now that I think about it, since there are the dungeons that are separate from the overworld and don\'t require a revisit unless you happen to miss something.) At the time, I (among others) thought that they still needed to make the next step towards a ""proper"" Metroidvania and they\'d truly have something.\n                     \n                     Then there was Half-Genie Hero. First off, it was weird that they began the Kickstarter for this game\n                     \n                      after\n                     \n                     Pirate\'s Curse had been announced, but\n                     \n                      before\n                     \n                     it actually released. We had only played the original game and Risky\'s Revenge at this point, and had the promise of Pirate\'s Curse releasing within a year or two. Additionally, the as-yet-unreleased Pirate\'s Curse had the best character art in the series (thanks to IntiCreates aiding with parts of the game) as well as the best pixel art, HGH went with more of a chibi-styled, smooth style. Still, more Shantae was more Shantae, and it felt like the series was finally getting its due (even if the fans had to pay for some of the development). Ultimately, though, the game was closer to a Mega Man X entry than the earlier games\' Metroidvania/sidescrolling Zelda style. There was no overworld with dungeons, but instead several independent platforming stages that you would select from a list. As with the MMX games, you could return to completed stages with new abilities to find more powerups. Unlike the MMX games, though, in which you get both permanent upgrades (helmet, boots, etc.) and special weapons you can easily swap between, Shantae has to stop and do a transformation dance in order to use her new abilities. It leads to a slower, less fun, platforming experience and I was ultimately disappointed in the game.\n                     \n                     Finally, this leads us to Seven Sirens. We finally got what we wanted, in a monkey\'s paw sort of way. There\'s a full, interconnected, Metroidvania map now! ...But there are also the Zelda-like dungeons that are independent of each other and the overworld. While some of these have been fun in earlier games, the dungeons I played in SS are very simple and straightforward. I\'d rather have just the connected map with more interesting platforming and puzzles. Additionally, early on you get an ability that reveals secrets, ranging from gems (money) to hidden platforms. The unfortunate part is that you get a visual notification on every screen in which there is something hidden, which is basically almost every screen, requiring you to stop and use the ability to try and find whatever it is. Most of the time, it\'s nothing special, and this power also uses mana (or whatever), so you need to fill it up after using it several times.\n                     \n                     All that to say that the series has come close to greatness, but never quite reaches it, and the best entry is now lost in the middle of a bunch of mediocre-at-best games.', ""I debate back and forth whether or not I like this or pirate's curse more. I like the change to one single open Metroidvania world when compared to the separate segmented ones of the past. The way transformations work is probably the best in the series with how seamless and fluid they are, but the dances feel a bit lame. There's so many different rooms where you can use them and most of the time there's nothing more than gems that you get out of them.\n                     \n                     I found the gameplay balancing to be a a bit out of wack as well. I played on the definitive mode that the game recommends and found the game much, much harder at the beginning. You are starved for healing items and resources, which made the beginning parts a lot more challenging than anything later. But by about 33% through the game I had more than enough money to keep myself capped on all of the healing items.\n                     \n                     The progression feels a bit too formulaic as well, with the game constantly switching between having you find x amount of mcguffins and then doing a dungeon and then repeating till the end. That said, I enjoyed the game overall. The world is fun to explore, the powers are interesting and the music is great."", ""Mixing the pirate's curse and half-genue forbids, this game makes for a fun time. While not as fluid as other titles, the focus is in the metroidvania aspect this time. An enjoyable game with an alright story."", 'Some of the writing was kind of funny, and the art was nice, but other than that it felt pretty phoned-in.', ""Thank goodness we have another Metroidvania-style Shantae game, and this time it's the classic kind. In terms of presentations this is easily the best in the saga, the overworld graphics and the portraits be looking pretty cute, and although the music may be the weakest in the saga, it has some catchy tunes. As for gameplay, they finally fixed the transformations problem, even if they're still not as good as the pirate gear in Pirate's Curse it's a step in the right direction. The game is great and a lot of fun, but it has some problems. The bosses are pretty bad, most of them consisting of dodging a sequence of three attacks and then hitting them for a while, rinse and repeat, although a couple of them are admittedly fun. The animated sequences look pretty rough too, but it's a noble concept that I hope to see expanded in later games. Finally, good god, trying to beat this game with 100% completion is a freaking chore, as most of the items you need are hidden or in a location that hasn't been relevant in a while, and there being no markers on the map to remember where they are is a missed opportunity. Either way, it's a pretty good game, the second best in the series, so if you liked Pirate's Curse but were not a fan of Half Genie Hero, I'd say play this to see how you like it."", ""The cleanest entry in the series with the most beautiful style and fun new transformations and characters, the OST is a bit different this time around- but it's honestly my favorite, it has so many bangers!

The reason canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. Cï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mon, fess up. Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age.

Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cf those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered.

To me, this comes across as a lazy attempt at raising the difficulty that subsequently forces me into a box of playing the 'right' solution, suppressing creativity in one's approach as you rely more on exploiting the AI, creating a much more stagnant, repetitive and aggravating experience that becomes an entirely different kind of grind. What I saw of the story was intriguing, but it's nowhere near enough to make me want to slog through the rest. The grind has a certain uniqueness that allows tiny incremental gains even at the level cap, but I can't shake the feeling that this just isn't respecting my time.

Meanwhile, horror games operate on the concept of player\n                     \n                      disempowerment\n                     \n                     , giving the bare minimum in order to foster a tense atmosphere, so balancing the priorities of each genre seems like mixing oil and water. Resident Evil games are famous for trying to do so, but they usually break into a horror-centric first half and an action-centric back half, without a true blending of the concepts. The Evil Within meanwhile actually managed it, but had to alienate players in some key ways in order to do so. Firstly, the logic behind the story is nearly impossible to follow at first, leaving players unable to find their footing, confused at why the progression is so jumpy and unfocused. Then, the mechanical restrictions feel like theyiýýre equally arbitrary: Sebastian can only initially carry about twelve bullets, and not even a full healthbarýýýs worth of recovery. He can barely run at all, and in order to alleviate any of this, you may have to bank up green gel over the course of multiple chapters. It can seem like the game is simply trying to make action feel scary by stressing out players with cheap deaths, but once you commit to learning the game, a brilliant method behind the madness reveals itself. While the story\n                     \n                      is\n                     \n                     mostly nonsense, the abstract nature of it allows for level design suited to a wide variety of challenges. With new mechanics being introduced at a steady pace, players are constantly kept on the backfoot, and thus disempowered, even as their growing mechanical knowledge empowers them. The shallow capacity for supplies is an obvious form of disempowerment which prompts players to spend resources cleverly, but their abundance between each fight empowers players to use their entire toolkit freely. The upgrade system empowers; the below-par baselines make unupgraded stats more of a problem in the face of scaling challenge. For every give, thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s a take, and thus, a harmony between action and horror is reached. As stated before though, the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½takeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for that brilliance is a frontloaded sense of disempowerment, with players having to get through most of the game before theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve experienced enough character growth and skill development to redress the balance. So, I really canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t blame anyone for bouncing off of this game, but I also truly believe that as of today (less than a week away from RE4 remake), itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s the best merging of action and horror in gaming.

Matches, distinctive survival horror, and potato aim (due to Sebastian\'s inherent human error, which some will complain about because if a game isn\'t 100% efficient to the player\'s skill it must be bad [this is explicitly directed to people like CarcinogenSDA who have expressed horrid opinions about this game]) are abandoned for half-baked exploration and an expanded story whose formulaic foundations can only be saved by the series\' great environmental and creature designs, particularly Camera Obscura.

I now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games, after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forward-moving feeling.

The Characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances, thanks to Chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man, Nadine worsened by trying to make us like her, by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale, without even regretting her actions, and made Sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character, to the point where he doesn\'t even bring his own grapple hook (even though he would never do that), stop writing feminism over male\'s feelings in games, and shame the people who think otherwise, the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first game\'s main villain, with his history with an old kingdom, but it doesn\'t go beyond that, and I enjoyed the traits of the second game\'s main villain more.  The Graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games, with some moments are awe (the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge, even if the second game\'s train scene was much better), but no where near as good as the fourth game, and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3, they have better looking events than the first game though.  The Gameplay is the same as before, only shorter to the point where it\'s less than half the length of games 2, 3, and 4, and in chapter 4, you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet, but no other moments like it make it feel random, silenced pistols were a great addition, but chapters 5, and especially 4 feel far too long, and could have been shortened, to make 2 more chapters, especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is.

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","['Samï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï""i don't like this game. ive seen it all the way through like 4 times"", 'camp', ""(Played before 2023)\n                     \n                     Probably the game with the best choices in this narrative-driven style game where the choices do matter, even if they don't create much branching paths.

The environments are beautiful but a little bland although this IS a game about a world already in ruin. This music is pretty cool and I enjoyed the multiple endings. Ultimately I had fun.', 'I think the most interesting thing about Valkyrie Elysium is that itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s not a story about saving the world. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s about what happens in that period where everything is ending already. Most of my time playing this game was spent in ruins, fighting the vengeful spirits that still roam the land alongside those spirits who chose to fight with me and listening to the voices that had long perished. And although Odin tells you from the beginniny walking through Valkyrie Elysiums world, the question haunted me: What is there left so save? This question is at the heart of the game. [Spoilers follow] The Valkyrie, a hollow shell at the beginning, distanced from the world she wants to save, becomes more and more involved over the course of the story ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ through the help of the spirits that chose to stay with her. And in the end, the player must choose what to do with that involvement. The different endings all give a different answer to the questions ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What is there left to save? What is there left to fight for?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The so-called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½true endingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ has a somewhat cynical answer to this: That the gods who were responsible for the worldsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ demise will not see the next one. Another ending plainly states: heterosexual love. In every ending the world we walked through in the game ends. The agency of the player is tce.
